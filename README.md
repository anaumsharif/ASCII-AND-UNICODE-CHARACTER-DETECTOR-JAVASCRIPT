## ASCII and Unicode Character Detector - JavaScript

The **ASCII and Unicode Character Detector** project is a web-based application developed using JavaScript that allows users to detect and identify whether a given character belongs to the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) or Unicode character set. This README provides an overview of the project's features, usage instructions, and implementation details.
The ASCII and Unicode Character Detector project is a web-based application developed using JavaScript that enables users to identify and distinguish between ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and Unicode characters based on input character values. This README provides a detailed description of the project's purpose, features, usage instructions, and implementation.

Project Overview
The primary goal of the ASCII and Unicode Character Detector project is to provide a user-friendly tool for determining whether a given character belongs to the ASCII character set or the Unicode character set. ASCII characters are a subset of Unicode characters, representing basic Latin characters and control codes, while Unicode encompasses a broader range of characters including international and special symbols.
### Project Overview

The **ASCII and Unicode Character Detector** project aims to provide users with a tool to determine the type of character (ASCII or Unicode) based on its Unicode code point value. This project leverages JavaScript to perform character identification and display the corresponding information to users.

### Key Features and Functionality

- **Character Identification**:
  - Allows users to input a character and detects whether it belongs to the ASCII or Unicode character set.

- **Unicode Code Point Lookup**:
  - Retrieves and displays the Unicode code point value of the input character.

- **Interactive User Interface**:
  - Provides a user-friendly interface with input fields and displays for character type and Unicode information.

### Usage Instructions

To use the **ASCII and Unicode Character Detector**:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anaumsharif/ASCII-AND-UNICODE-CHARACTER-DETECTOR-JAVASCRIPT.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ascii-unicode-character-detector
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in a Web Browser**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).

4. **Enter a Character**:
   - Input a character (e.g., 'A', '€', 'あ') into the provided text field.

5. **Detect Character Type**:
   - Click the "Detect Character Type" button to determine whether the input character is ASCII or Unicode.
   - The application will display the character type and its Unicode code point value.

### Project Structure

The **ASCII and Unicode Character Detector** project consists of the following files:

- **`index.html`**:
  - HTML file containing the structure of the character detector interface.

- **`styles.css`**:
  - CSS file for styling the character detector interface.

- **`script.js`**:
  - JavaScript file containing the logic to detect character type and retrieve Unicode information.

### Implementation Details

The **ASCII and Unicode Character Detector** is implemented using JavaScript:

- **JavaScript (`script.js`)**:
  - Defines functions to identify whether a character is ASCII or Unicode based on its Unicode code point value.
  - Retrieves and displays the Unicode code point value of the input character.

### Example

Interact with the **ASCII and Unicode Character Detector** by entering different characters and observing the detected character type and Unicode information:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: 'A'
  - Result: "ASCII Character | Unicode Code Point: U+0041"

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: '€'
  - Result: "Unicode Character | Unicode Code Point: U+20AC"

### Contributing and License

Contributions to the **ASCII and Unicode Character Detector** project are welcome! You can contribute by improving character identification accuracy, enhancing the user interface, or adding support for additional character sets.

This project is open-source and distributed under the [MIT License](LICENSE), allowing for modification, distribution, and use in other projects.

### Next Steps

After using the **ASCII and Unicode Character Detector**, consider exploring further enhancements and extensions:

- **Extended Character Set Support**: Expand the application to detect characters from other character sets such as UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1.
  
- **Character Information Display**: Enhance the user interface to display additional character information such as character name, category, and description.

Experiment with different characters and Unicode code point values to deepen your understanding of character encoding and Unicode standards while improving the functionality and usability of the **ASCII and Unicode Character Detector** application.

---

The **ASCII and Unicode Character Detector** project offers a practical tool for identifying and understanding character encoding in JavaScript. Start using the application to detect character types and explore Unicode code point values. Customize and extend the project to support additional character sets and enhance your skills in web development.
